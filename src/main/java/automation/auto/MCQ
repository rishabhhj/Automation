        }
        class mainclass
        {
            public static void main(String args[])
            {
                 box obj = new box();
                 obj.width = 10;
                 obj.height = 2;
                 obj.length = 10;
                 int y = obj.width * obj.height * obj.length;
                 System.out.print(y);
            }
        }

       class mainclass
       {
           public static void main(String args[])
           {
               box obj1 = new box();
               box obj2 = new box();
               obj1.height = 1;

               obj1.width = 1;
               obj2 = obj1;
               System.out.println(obj2.height);
           }
       }
